## #5 Performance Test (optional)

If I were tasked with designing a performance test for [https://www.sofa.de/](https://www.sofa.de/), I would focus on the following scenario:

**Target Area:**
- The checkout process (from adding items to the basket through to order confirmation)

**Reason:**
- This is a critical business flow where performance issues can directly impact conversion rates and user satisfaction. It often involves multiple backend services (cart, pricing, payment, user, etc.) and is sensitive to delays.

**Testing Approach:**
- Simulate a high number of concurrent users performing the checkout flow, including:
  - Browsing categories and product pages
  - Adding items to the basket
  - Viewing the basket and proceeding to checkout
  - Filling in shipping and payment details
  - Placing an order
- Measure response times, error rates, and system resource usage at each step.
- Identify bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle expected peak loads.

**Parameters:**
- Number of concurrent users (e.g., 100, 500, 1000)
- Ramp-up time (how quickly users are added)
- Test duration (e.g., 10-30 minutes)
- Success criteria (e.g., 95% of requests complete within 2 seconds, <1% error rate)

**Tools:**
- JMeter, k6, or similar load testing tools

**Outcome:**
- The test would help ensure the checkout process remains fast and reliable under load, providing a good user experience and supporting business goals.
